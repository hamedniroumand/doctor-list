# Doctor List - Vue 2

In developing this project, which I did with Vue 2, I used **models**, **services**, **directives**, **filters**, and **mixins**.

One of the particular points of the development of this product is the development of a wholly dedicated **validation** with separate **rules**, which has a lot of flexibility.

Another noteworthy point is the developing of a **multi-select** component with the ability to **search** for items developed in this project.
